a. missing {} for if statement, shouldn't have semi coloum after if statement, missing {} for else statement.
b. The variable total is not initialized, causing an undefined value issue. should separate x and total for initialized.
c. "While" should be "while". missing {} for while loop, and the increment should be inside the loop block.
d. "++y" should be "--y". otherwise it's a infinte loop.

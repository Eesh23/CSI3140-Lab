               The <strong>color</strong> input type (Fig. 3.1; lines 20&ndash;21)
               enables the user to enter a color. At the time of this writing, most browsers render the <strong>color input</strong> type as a text field in which the user can enter a hexadecimal
               code or a code name. In the future, when you click a <strong> color input</strong>, browsers will likly dispaly a <i>color picker</i> similiar to the Microsoft Windows color dialog shown in Fig. 3.2.            </p>

            <em><strong>autofocus</strong> Attribute</em>
            <p>
               The <strong>autofocus</strong> attribute (Fig. 3.1; line 20)&mdash;an
               optional attribute that can be used in only one <strong>input</strong> 
               element on a form&mdash;automatically gives the focus
               to the <strong>input</strong> element, allowing the user to begin typing
               in that element immediately. Figure 3.3 shows <strong>autofocus</strong> on
               the color element&mdash;the first input element in our
               form&mdash;as rendered in Chrome. You do not need to
               include autofocus in your forms.

            <em>Validation</em>
            <p>
               Traditionally it's been difficult to validate user
               input, such as ensuring that an e-mail address, URL,
               date or time is entered in the proper format. The new
               HTML 5 input types are self validating on the client
               side, eliminating the need to add complicated
               JavaScript code to your web pages to validate user
               input, reducing the amount of invalid data submitted
               and consequently reducing Internet traffic between the
               server and the client to correct invalid input.<i>The server should still validate all user input</i>
               When a user enters data into a form then submits the
               form (in this example, by clicking the <b>Submit</b> button),
               the browser immediately checks the self-validating
               elements to ensure that the data is correct. For
               example, if a user enters an incorrect hexadecimal
               color value when using a browser that renders the color
               elements as a text field (e.g., Chrome), a callout
               pointing to the element will appear, indicating that an
               invalid value was entered (Fig. 3.4). Figure 3.5 lists
               each of the new HTML5 <strong>input</strong> types and provides examples
               of the proper formats required for each type of data to be valid.
